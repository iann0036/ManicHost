    <h2 id="udrp">Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy</h2>
    <p>(As Approved by ICANN on October 24, 1999 and implemented by manic.host, on March 01, 2015)</p>

    <ol>
        <li><p><b>Purpose.</b></p>
            <p>This Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the "Policy") has been adopted by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"), is incorporated by reference into your Registration Agreement, and sets forth the terms and conditions in connection with a dispute between you and any party other than us (the registrar) over the registration and use of an Internet domain name registered by you. Proceedings under Paragraph 4 of this Policy will be conducted according to the Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the "Rules of Procedure"), which are available at www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm, and the selected administrative-dispute-resolution service provider's supplemental rules.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>Your Representations.</b></p>
            <p>By applying to register a domain name, or by asking us to maintain or renew a domain name registration, you hereby represent and warrant to us that (a) the statements that you made in your Registration Agreement are complete and accurate; (b) to your knowledge, the registration of the domain name will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party; (c) you are not registering the domain name for an unlawful purpose; and (d) you will not knowingly use the domain name in violation of any applicable laws or regulations. It is your responsibility to determine whether your domain name registration infringes or violates someone else's rights.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>Cancellations, Transfers, and Changes.</b></p>
            <p>We will cancel, transfer or otherwise make changes to domain name registrations under the following circumstances:</p>

        <p>a. subject to the provisions of Paragraph 8, our receipt of written or appropriate electronic instructions from you or your authorized agent to take such action;</p>

        <p>b. our receipt of an order from a court or arbitral tribunal, in each case of competent jurisdiction, requiring such action; and/or</p>

        <p>c. our receipt of a decision of an Administrative Panel requiring such action in any administrative proceeding to which you were a party and which was conducted under this Policy or a later version of this Policy adopted by ICANN. (See Paragraph 4(i) and (k) below.)</p>

        <p>We may also cancel, transfer or otherwise make changes to a domain name registration in accordance with the terms of your Registration Agreement or other legal requirements.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>Mandatory Administrative Proceeding.</b></p>

        <p>This Paragraph sets forth the type of disputes for which you are required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding. These proceedings will be conducted before one of the administrative-dispute-resolution service providers listed at www.icann.org/udrp/approved-providers.htm (each, a "Provider").</p>

        <p>a. <b>Applicable Disputes.</b> You are required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding in the event that a third party (a "complainant") asserts to the applicable Provider, in compliance with the Rules of Procedure, that

        (i) your domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and

        (ii) you have no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and

        (iii) your domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.</p>

        In the administrative proceeding, the complainant must prove that each of these three elements are present.

        <p>b. <b>Evidence of Registration and Use in Bad Faith.</b> For the purposes of Paragraph 4(a)(iii), the following circumstances, in particular but without limitation, if found by the Panel to be present, shall be evidence of the registration and use of a domain name in bad faith:

        (i) circumstances indicating that you have registered or you have acquired the domain name primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the domain name registration to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or service mark or to a competitor of that complainant, for valuable consideration in excess of your documented out-of-pocket costs directly related to the domain name; or

        (ii) you have registered the domain name in order to prevent the owner of the trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name, provided that you have engaged in a pattern of such conduct; or

        (iii) you have registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business of a competitor; or

        (iv) by using the domain name, you have intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to your web site or other on-line location, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant's mark as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of your web site or location or of a product or service on your web site or location.
        </p>
        <p>c. <b>How to Demonstrate Your Rights to and Legitimate Interests in the Domain Name in Responding to a Complaint.</b> When you receive a complaint, you should refer to Paragraph 5 of the Rules of Procedure in determining how your response should be prepared. Any of the following circumstances, in particular but without limitation, if found by the Panel to be proved based on its evaluation of all evidence presented, shall demonstrate your rights or legitimate interests to the domain name for purposes of Paragraph 4(a)(ii):

        (i) before any notice to you of the dispute, your use of, or demonstrable preparations to use, the domain name or a name corresponding to the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services; or

        (ii) you (as an individual, business, or other organization) have been commonly known by the domain name, even if you have acquired no trademark or service mark rights; or

        (iii) you are making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the domain name, without intent for commercial gain to misleadingly divert consumers or to tarnish the trademark or service mark at issue.
        </p>
        <p>d. <b>Selection of Provider.</b> The complainant shall select the Provider from among those approved by ICANN by submitting the complaint to that Provider. The selected Provider will administer the proceeding, except in cases of consolidation as described in Paragraph 4(f).</p>

        <p>e. <b>Initiation of Proceeding and Process and Appointment of Administrative Panel.</b> The Rules of Procedure state the process for initiating and conducting a proceeding and for appointing the panel that will decide the dispute (the "Administrative Panel").</p>

        <p>f. <b>Consolidation.</b> In the event of multiple disputes between you and a complainant, either you or the complainant may petition to consolidate the disputes before a single Administrative Panel. This petition shall be made to the first Administrative Panel appointed to hear a pending dispute between the parties. This Administrative Panel may consolidate before it any or all such disputes in its sole discretion, provided that the disputes being consolidated are governed by this Policy or a later version of this Policy adopted by ICANN.</p>

        <p>g. <b>Fees.</b> All fees charged by a Provider in connection with any dispute before an Administrative Panel pursuant to this Policy shall be paid by the complainant, except in cases where you elect to expand the Administrative Panel from one to three panelists as provided in Paragraph 5(b)(iv) of the Rules of Procedure, in which case all fees will be split evenly by you and the complainant.</p>

        <p>h. <b>Our Involvement in Administrative Proceedings.</b> We do not, and will not, participate in the administration or conduct of any proceeding before an Administrative Panel. In addition, we will not be liable as a result of any decisions rendered by the Administrative Panel.</p>

        <p>i. <b>Remedies.</b> The remedies available to a complainant pursuant to any proceeding before an Administrative Panel shall be limited to requiring the cancellation of your domain name or the transfer of your domain name registration to the complainant.</p>

        <p>j. <b>Notification and Publication.</b> The Provider shall notify us of any decision made by an Administrative Panel with respect to a domain name you have registered with us. All decisions under this Policy will be published in full over the Internet, except when an Administrative Panel determines in an exceptional case to redact portions of its decision.</p>

        <p>k. <b>Availability of Court Proceedings.</b> The mandatory administrative proceeding requirements set forth in Paragraph 4 shall not prevent either you or the complainant from submitting the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction for independent resolution before such mandatory administrative proceeding is commenced or after such proceeding is concluded. If an Administrative Panel decides that your domain name registration should be canceled or transferred, we will wait ten (10) business days (as observed in the location of our principal office) after we are informed by the applicable Provider of the Administrative Panel's decision before implementing that decision. We will then implement the decision unless we have received from you during that ten (10) business day period official documentation (such as a copy of a complaint, file-stamped by the clerk of the court) that you have commenced a lawsuit against the complainant in a jurisdiction to which the complainant has submitted under Paragraph 3(b)(xiii) of the Rules of Procedure. (In general, that jurisdiction is either the location of our principal office or of your address as shown in our Whois database. See Paragraphs 1 and 3(b)(xiii) of the Rules of Procedure for details.) If we receive such documentation within the ten (10) business day period, we will not implement the Administrative Panel's decision, and we will take no further action, until we receive (i) evidence satisfactory to us of a resolution between the parties; (ii) evidence satisfactory to us that your lawsuit has been dismissed or withdrawn; or (iii) a copy of an order from such court dismissing your lawsuit or ordering that you do not have the right to continue to use your domain name.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>All Other Disputes and Litigation.</b></p>
            <p>All other disputes between you and any party other than us regarding your domain name registration that are not brought pursuant to the mandatory administrative proceeding provisions of Paragraph 4 shall be resolved between you and such other party through any court, arbitration or other proceeding that may be available.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>Our Involvement in Disputes.</b></p>
            <p>We will not participate in any way in any dispute between you and any party other than us regarding the registration and use of your domain name. You shall not name us as a party or otherwise include us in any such proceeding. In the event that we are named as a party in any such proceeding, we reserve the right to raise any and all defenses deemed appropriate, and to take any other action necessary to defend ourselves.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>Maintaining the Status Quo.</b></p>
            <p>We will not cancel, transfer, activate, deactivate, or otherwise change the status of any domain name registration under this Policy except as provided in Paragraph 3 above.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>Transfers During a Dispute.</b></p>

        <p>a. <b>Transfers of a Domain Name to a New Holder.</b> You may not transfer your domain name registration to another holder (i) during a pending administrative proceeding brought pursuant to Paragraph 4 or for a period of fifteen (15) business days (as observed in the location of our principal place of business) after such proceeding is concluded; or (ii) during a pending court proceeding or arbitration commenced regarding your domain name unless the party to whom the domain name registration is being transferred agrees, in writing, to be bound by the decision of the court or arbitrator. We reserve the right to cancel any transfer of a domain name registration to another holder that is made in violation of this subparagraph.</p>

        <p>b. <b>Changing Registrars.</b> You may not transfer your domain name registration to another registrar during a pending administrative proceeding brought pursuant to Paragraph 4 or for a period of fifteen (15) business days (as observed in the location of our principal place of business) after such proceeding is concluded. You may transfer administration of your domain name registration to another registrar during a pending court action or arbitration, provided that the domain name you have registered with us shall continue to be subject to the proceedings commenced against you in accordance with the terms of this Policy. In the event that you transfer a domain name registration to us during the pendency of a court action or arbitration, such dispute shall remain subject to the domain name dispute policy of the registrar from which the domain name registration was transferred.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>Policy Modifications.</b></p>

        <p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time with the permission of ICANN. Unless this Policy has already been invoked by the submission of a complaint to a Provider, in which event the version of the Policy in effect at the time it was invoked will apply to you until the dispute is over, all such changes will be binding upon you with respect to any domain name registration dispute, whether the dispute arose before, on or after the effective date of our change. In the event that you object to a change in this Policy, your sole remedy is to cancel your domain name registration with us, provided that you will not be entitled to a refund of any fees you paid to us. The revised Policy will apply to you until you cancel your domain name registration.</p>

    <li><p><b>CHANGES TO AGREEMENT.</b></p>
        <p>This Agreement will change over time in response to changes in the requirements of governments and administrative bodies, legislation and changes in the nature of industry. If, as a result of such a change to this Agreement, you no longer agree with its term, you agree that your exclusive remedy is to transfer your domain name registration services to another registrar or request Manic Host to cancel your domain name registration and/or related Services.

You agree to review this Agreement periodically to make yourself aware of any such revisions.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>TERM.</b></p>
        <p>The term of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as long as you have any domain name registered through Manic Host or as long as you are employing any Service(s).  You agree that you will not transfer any domain name registered through Manic Host to another domain name registrar during the first sixty (60) calendar days from its initial registration date. You further agree that, due to ICANN's new Add Grace Period policy, effective April 01, 2009, Manic Host is canceling the three (3) day grace period and will no longer offer refunds for any domain deletions on new registrations. All domain registrations are final.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>SERVICE(S) PROVIDED AT WILL AND TERMINATION OF SERVICE(S).</b></p>
        <p>We may reject your domain name registration application or elect to discontinue providing Service(s) to you for any reason within 30 days of a Service initiation or a Service renewal. Outside of this period, we may terminate or suspend the Service(s) at any time for cause, which, without limitation, includes registration of prohibited domain name(s), abuse of the Services, payment irregularities, material allegations of illegal conduct, or if your use of the Services involves us in a violation of any Internet Service Provider's ("ISP's") acceptable use policies, including the transmission of unsolicited bulk email. You agree that if we terminate or suspend the Services provided to you under this Agreement, that we may then, at our option, make either ourselves or a third party the beneficiary of Services which are substantially similar to those which were previously providing to you and that any reference in this Agreement to termination or suspension of the Services to you includes this option. If we have grounds to terminate or suspend Service(s) with respect to one domain name or in relation to other Service(s) provided through your account, we may terminate or suspend all Service(s) provided through your account, including Service(s) to other domain names maintained by you with us. No fee refund will be made when there is a suspension or termination of Service(s) for cause. At any time and for any reason, we may terminate the Services thirty (30) days after we send notice of termination via mail or email, at our option, to the WHOIS contact information provided in association with your domain name registration. Following notice of termination other than for cause, you must transfer your domain name or risk that we may delete your domain name or suspend or modify Services to it. If we terminate Services for a reason other than cause, we will attempt to refund your fees. You further acknowledge and agree that your registration of a domain name is subject to suspension, cancellation or transfer by any ICANN procedure, by any registrar or registry administrator procedures approved by an ICANN-adopted policy, to correct mistakes by us, another registrar or the registry administrator in administering the domain name or for the resolution of disputes concerning the domain name.  You agree that your failure to comply completely with the terms and conditions of this agreement and any Manic Host rule or policy may be considered by Manic Host to be a material breach of this agreement and that Manic Host may provide you with notice of such breach either in writing or electronically (i.e. email). In the event you do not provide Manic Host with material evidence that you have not breached your obligations to Manic Host within ten (10) business days, Manic Host may terminate its relationship with you and take any remedial action available to Manic Host under the applicable laws. Such remedial action may be implemented without notice to you and may include, but is not limited to, canceling the registration of any of your domain names and discontinuing any services provided by Manic Host to you.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>OUR SERVICES.</b>
        <ul>
        <li><b>DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION.</b> We are an accredited registrar with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") for Top Level Domain Names ("TLDs") (such as .com, .net, .org, etc.). ICANN oversees registrations and other aspects of the TLDs. Domain name registrations are not effective until the registry administrator puts them into effect. Domain name registrations are only for limited terms, terms which end on the expiration date. For domain names which are created as a new registration out of the available namespace, the term begins on the date the domain name registration is acknowledged by the applicable registry; for domain names registrations which were not returned to the available namespace, the term begins on the date the previous registrant's domain name registration was acknowledged by the applicable registry. You agree that we are not liable or responsible in any way for any errors, omissions or any other actions by the registry administrator arising out of or related to a request to register, renew, modify the settings for, or transfer of a domain name registration (our limitation of liability is explained further, below). You further agree that domain name registration is a service, that domain name registrations do not exist independently from services provided pursuant to this or a similar registration agreement with a registrar, and that domain name registration services do not create a property interest.</li>

        <li><b>AFTER MARKET DOMAIN NAMES.</b> We offer for sale domain names that are registered to third parties (also known as aftermarket domain names) in a variety of top level domain names ("TLDs") ("After Market Domain Name(s)"). All After Market Domain Name registrations are offered on a first come, first served basis. If you are the first to complete an After Market Domain Name registration application for a particular domain name, including payment of the purchase price we designate, we will initiate a transfer of the relevant After Market Domain Name to your Account. If the After Market Domain Name is at another domain registrar at the time of your purchase, we will transfer your purchased After Market Domain Name to us at no cost to you and will add one year to the existing registration period. Any subsequent renewals of the After Market Domain Name will be charged at the then-current renewal fee. Once you submit your order for an After Market Domain Name, you have entered into a valid, binding and enforceable contract to pay the designated purchase price for the After Market Domain Name. Because we are selling After Market Domain Names initially registered to third parties, we have no control and make no representations regarding the accuracy or legality of domain names advertised, the accuracy or legality of any domain name listing, or the right and the ability of the third party seller to transfer the After Market Domain Name or complete the transaction. We do not control whether or not third party sellers will complete a transaction. We reserve the right to reject or cancel your After Market Domain Name registration for any reason including, but not limited to, any pricing errors. In the event your After Market Domain Name registration is rejected or cancelled by us, for any reason, we will refund in full the amount of the purchase price for the After Market Domain Name as your sole remedy. Once the After Market Domain Name is transferred into your Account, such After Market Domain Name may not be transferred away from us to another registrar during the first 60 days following the transfer, during which time the After Market Domain Name may be placed on transfer lock. All of your obligations under this Agreement which apply to the registration or renewal of domain name(s) created by you apply to any After Market Domain Name(s) acquired by you, including but not limited to prohibition against any Illegal Uses.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>AGREEMENT NOT TO USE “SERVICES” FOR IMPROPER PURPOSE.</b></p>
        <p>You agree not to use the Services provided by Manic Host, or to allow or enable others, to use the services provided by Manic Host for the purposes of: 1) the transmission of unsolicited email (Spam); or 2) repetitive, high volume inquires into any of the services provided by Manic Host (i.e. domain name availability, etc.).  Further, if you are hosting your domain's domain name servers ("DNS") on Manic Host’s servers, or are using our systems to forward a domain, URL, or otherwise to a system or site hosted elsewhere, or if you have your domain name registered with Manic Host, you are responsible for ensuring that there is no excessive overloading of Manic Host’s DNS systems. You may not use Manic Host’s servers and your domain as a source, intermediary, reply to address, or destination address for mail bombs, Internet packet flooding, packet corruption, or other abusive attack. Server hacking or other perpetration of security breaches is prohibited. You agree that Manic Host reserves the right to deactivate your domain name from its DNS system if Manic Host deems it is the recipient of activities caused by your site that threaten the stability of its network.</p>
        <p>You agree that Manic Host, in its sole discretion and without liability to you, may refuse to accept the registration of any domain name. Manic Host also may in its sole discretion and without liability to you delete the registration of any domain name during the first five (5) days after registration has taken place.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>YOUR OBLIGATIONS TO ENSURE ENTITLEMENT TO USE DOMAIN NAME.</b></p>
        <p>Without limitation, the following are not included in the Services: We cannot and do not check to see whether the domain name(s) you select, or the use you make of the domain name(s), or other of the Service(s), infringes legal rights of others. It is your responsibility to know whether or not the domain name(s) you select or use infringes legal rights of others. We might be ordered by a court to cancel, modify, or transfer your domain name; it is your responsibility to list accurate contact information in association with your account and to communicate with litigants, potential litigants, and governmental authorities. It is not our responsibility to forward court orders or other communications to you. We will comply with court orders unless you contact us to contest the order.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>THREATENED LEGAL ACTION(S).</b></p>
        <p>If we are sued or threatened with a lawsuit, an administrative proceeding or any other legal or administrative proceeding in connection with Service(s) provided to you, we may turn to you to indemnify us and to hold us harmless from the claims and expenses (including attorney's fees and court costs). Under such circumstances, you agree that you will, upon demand, obtain a performance bond with a reputable bonding company or, if you are unable to obtain a performance bond, that you will deposit money with us to pay for our reasonably anticipated expenses in relation to the matter for the coming year. Such deposit will be drawn down as expenses are incurred, with all account notices sent to the WHOIS contact information provided in association with your domain names and/or account. We shall not be obliged to extend you any credit in relation to such expenses and we may terminate the Services for a failure to make or renew such a deposit. We will return any unused deposit upon the later of three (3) months from deposit or the conclusion of the matter.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICY.</b></p>
        <p>You agree to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy ("UDRP"), a copy of which is available at http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm and http://www.icann.org/dndr/udrp/policy.htm. You agree that the UDRP may be changed by ICANN (or ICANN's successor) at any time and that such a change will be binding upon you. You agree that, if the registration or reservation of your domain name is challenged by a third party, you will be subject to the provisions specified in the UDRP in effect at the time your domain name registration is disputed by the third party. You also agree that, in the event a domain name dispute arises with any third party, you will indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions of the UDRP. You also understand that it is important for you to regularly monitor email sent to the email address associated with your account and domain names because, among other reasons, if a dispute arises regarding Services provided to you, you may lose your rights to receive the Services if you do not respond expeditiously to an email sent in conjunction therewith.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>FEES AND PAYMENTS.</b></p>
        <p>As consideration for the Service(s), renewal of the Service(s), and, if you select it, automatic renewal of the Service(s), you agree to pay, prior to the effectiveness of the desired Service(s), the applicable Service(s) fees. All fees are non-refundable, in whole or in part, even if your domain name registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your then current registration term, unless this Agreement specifically provides for a refund. You may pay for Services by providing a valid credit or debit card, an electronic check (from your personal or business checking account, as appropriate), PayPal, Bitcoin, Dwolla, or any other payment method then accepted by Manic Host (each, a “Payment Method”); provided, however, that we may at our option require that you pay fees through a particular payment means (such as by credit card or by wire transfer) or that you change from one payment provider to another. Manic Host expressly reserves the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be posted online on the Manic Host website and effective immediately without need for further notice to you.  If you have purchased the Service(s) for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when the Service(s) in question come up for renewal as further described below.  For our current fee structure, you may access the schedule of fees available on the Manic Host website: New Registration Fees Renewal Fees Post-Expiration Renewal Fees Redemption Fees In the event of a refund, Manic Host will issue you a refund receipt to confirm its submission of your refund to the Payment Method charged at the time of the original purchase. You acknowledge and agree that the associated payment provider and/or individual issuing bank establish and regulate the time frames for posting your refund.  Refund posting time frames may range from five (5) business days to a full billing cycle. If Manic Host is for any reason unable to charge your chosen Payment Method for the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if Manic Host is charged a penalty for any fee previously charged to your Payment Method, you agree that Manic Host may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment. You agree that the remedies Manic Host may pursue in order to effect payment shall include, but not be limited to, suspension of Services, cancellation of domain names registered through our Services, and/or suspension of access to any and all accounts you have with us and/or your Primary Service Provider; and that all rights to and interest in and use of any domain name registration(s) services, website hosting, and/or email services, including all data hosted on our systems shall be assumed by us in satisfaction of any indebtedness by you to us. We will reinstate your rights to and control over these Services solely at our discretion, and subject to our receipt of the unpaid fee(s) and our reinstatement fee, currently set at $200 (US Dollars). Charges for the Service(s) will be billed to your chosen Payment Method as charges for “MANIC.HOST.”   Manic Host also reserves the right to charge you reasonable “administrative fees” or “processing fees” for (i) tasks Manic Host may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs Manic Host may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by Manic Host in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical scenarios include, but are not limited to, customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention, fees incurred by third-party payment providers such as PayPal, Dwolla or Alipay, fees incurred as the result of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank, or a Payment Method processor, and disputes that require accounting or legal services. These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method you have on file with Manic Host.
    <li><p><b>AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OFFER TERMS.</b></p>
        <p>IN ORDER TO HELP ENSURE THAT YOU DO NOT EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, WE OFFER AN AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION FOR MOST OF OUR SERVICES.  WHEN YOU SELECT THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION, WE WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) FOR A RENEWAL PERIOD EQUAL IN TIME TO THE ORIGINAL SERVICE PERIOD.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOUR ORIGINAL SERVICE PERIOD WAS FOR ONE YEAR, YOUR RENEWAL PERIOD WILL BE FOR ONE YEAR.  YOU MUST SELECT THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION AT THE TIME OF YOUR ORGINAL PURCHASE, OR SUBSEQUENTLY MODIFY YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS TO ACTIVATE THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION FOR THE SERVICE(S).  ONCE YOU HAVE SELECTED THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION, MANIC HOST WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW THE APPLICABLE SERVICE ON THE AUTO-RENEWAL DATE IDENTIFIED IN THE “UPCOMING AUTO-RENEWAL NOTIFICATION” EMAIL YOU WILL RECEIVE, AND WILL TAKE PAYMENT FROM THE PAYMENT METHOD YOU HAVE ON FILE WITH MANIC HOST AT THE THEN-CURRENT RATES STATED IN THE “UPCOMING AUTO-RENEWAL NOTIFICATION” FOR THE SERVICES, WHICH YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE MAY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE RATES FOR THE ORIGINAL SERVICE PERIOD.  DETAILS ON HOW TO VIEW AND MODIFY THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL SETTINGS FOR THE SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ACCOUNT MAY BE FOUND WITHIN THE MANIC HOST KNOWLEDGEBASE AT: TURNING THE AUTO-RENEWAL FEATURE ON/OFF.   YOU MAY ENABLE OR DISABLE THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION AT ANY TIME.  HOWEVER, SHOULD YOU ELECT TO DISABLE THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION AND FAIL TO MANUALLY RENEW YOUR SERVICES BEFORE THEY EXPIRE, YOU MAY EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, AND MANIC HOST SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES.   MANIC HOST MAY ALSO PARTICIPATE IN “RECURRING BILLING PROGRAMS” OR “ACCOUNT UPDATER SERVICES” SUPPORTED BY YOUR CREDIT CARD PROVIDER (AND ULTIMATELY DEPENDENT ON YOUR BANK’S PARTICIPATION).  IF YOU HAVE SELECTED THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION AND WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY CHARGE YOUR EXISTING PAYMENT METHOD, YOUR CREDIT CARD PROVIDER (OR YOUR BANK) MAY NOTIFY US OF UPDATES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND/OR EXPIRATION DATE, OR THEY MAY AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE YOUR NEW CREDIT CARD ON OUR BEHALF WITHOUT NOTIFICATION TO US.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH RECURRING BILLING PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS, IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE NOTIFIED OF AN UPDATE TO YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND/OR EXPIRATION DATE, MANIC HOST WILL AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE YOUR PAYMENT PROFILE ON YOUR BEHALF.  MANIC HOST MAKES NO GUARANTEES THAT WE WILL REQUEST OR RECEIVE UPDATED CREDIT CARD INFORMATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO MODIFY AND MAINTAIN YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO (A) SETTING YOUR RENEWAL OPTIONS AND (B) ENSURING YOUR ASSOCIATED PAYMENT METHOD(S) ARE CURRENT AND VALID.  FURTHER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR FAILURE TO DO SO, MAY RESULT IN THE INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, AND MANIC HOST SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>EXPIRATION AND RENEWAL OF SERVICE(S) AND NOTIFICATIONS OF EXPIRATION.</b></p>
        <p>You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to keep your own records and to maintain your own reminders regarding when your domain name registration or other Services are set to expire. However, ICANN requires, pursuant to its Expired Registration Recovery Policy (“ERRP”) that Manic Host follow certain procedures to notify you in advance that renewal fees are due. Pursuant to the ERRP, Manic Host will notify the registered name holder of the expiring domain name twice before the expiration date, once approximately one month before the subject domain’s expiration date and again approximately one week before the subject domain’s expiration date. Manic Host’s renewal reminder will consist of an email message sent to the registered domain holder’s email address as it is listed in the expiring domain’s WHOIS record. Further, Manic Host reserves the option, but not the obligation, to send additional renewal reminder notices to any other email addresses associated with the expiring domain, including, but not limited to, the email address of the expiring domain’s account holder or the billing contact of the expiring domain’s WHOIS record. Manic Host also reserves the option, but not the obligation, to send additional renewal reminders at times other than the times required by the ERRP.  Manic Host offers you the choice of selecting either the “Automatic Renewal” option, or maintaining the default “Manual Renewal” option setting, for the Service(s) associated with your account: (a) Automatic Renewal.  If you select the Automatic Renewal option, Manic Host will automatically renew, for a period equivalent to the length of your original domain name registration, any domain name (and/or WhoisGuard service plan) that is up for renewal and will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with Manic Host, at Manic Host’s then current rates. Thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for one (1) year, Manic Host will automatically renew it for one (1) year. If you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, Manic Host will automatically renew it for two (2) years, and so on. Manual Renewal is the default setting. Therefore, you must select Automatic Renewal at the time of your enrollment, or subsequently modify your account settings, to enroll in the Automatic Renewal plan.  (b) Manual Renewal.  Manual Renewal is the default setting.  Therefore, if you do not affirmatively select that the domain name be automatically renewed through Automatic Renewal, you have the responsibility of logging into your account and manually implementing the renewal for the domain or other Services by the expiration date (should you in fact want the domain name to be renewed). If you fail to manually implement the renewal before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name. Payment by the selected Payment Method must be made in full prior to the expiration date stated in the pre-expiration notifications sent to you by us. If you select Automatic Renewal of the Service(s), we will attempt to renew the Service(s) on the Automatic Renewal date stated in our “Upcoming Auto-Renewal Notification” to you, provided you have sufficient available funds/credit associated with your selected Payment Method to complete the transaction and your account information is up to date. You acknowledge and agree that, while we are not required to, we may contact you with a request to update your account information in the event that an attempted transaction is not processed successfully. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to keep your billing information up to date. You acknowledge and understand that, as part of its management of user registrations, Manic Host sends out periodic notices to registrants apprising them of payment deadlines, pending expiration deadlines and other important information affecting your account and, specifically, registration of domain names. Specifically, any notifications regarding domain registrations, including but not limited to notifications consisting of pre-expiration and post-expiration notifications concerning your registered domains will be sent to you pursuant to ICANN’s policies, including, but not limited to, the ERRP. Where appropriate, Manic Host will send such notices to the e-mail address of the subject domain’s registered domain holder, the e-mail address you provided as your contact information in connection with your account associated with the subject domain, and/or any other email address that Manic Host determines, in its sole discretion, to be sufficiently related to the subject domain to warrant notice. You therefore acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to provide and maintain accurate account information and domain name WHOIS information, as more fully addressed in Paragraph 13 below, so that Manic Host may provide you with important notices regarding your account.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>ACCURATE ACCOUNT CONTACT INFORMATION AND DOMAIN NAME WHOIS INFORMATION.</b></p>
        <p>As further consideration for the Service(s), you agree to provide certain current, complete and accurate information about you, both with respect to your account information and with respect to the WHOIS information for your domain name(s). You agree to maintain and update this information as needed to keep it current, complete and accurate. With respect to you, the administrative, technical, and billing contacts for your domain name registration(s) and other Service(s), you must submit the following: name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and, if available, fax number. You agree that the type of information you are required to provide may change and you understand that, if you do not provide the newly required information, your registration or and/or other Service(s) may be suspended or terminated or may not be renewed. In the event the lack of accurate/current contact information results in the loss, cancellation or transfer of the domain name(s) associated with your account, you agree that you shall not hold Manic Host liable for any such loss or any damages associated with the loss.  Not providing requested information may prevent you from obtaining all Service(s). You may provide information regarding the name-servers assigned to your domain name(s) and, if we are providing name-server services to you, the DNS settings for the domain name. You agree to notify Manic Host within five (5) business days when any of the information you provided as part of the application and/or registration process changes. It is your responsibility to keep this information in a current and accurate status. Failure by you, for whatever reason, to provide Manic Host with accurate and reliable information on an initial and continual basis, shall be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement.  Failure by you, for whatever reason, to respond within five (5) business days to any inquiries made by Manic Host to determine the validity of information provided by you, shall also be considered to be a material breach of this agreement. You agree to retain a copy for your record of the receipt for purchase of your domain name or Services. You acknowledge and agree that domain name registration requires that this contact information, in whole or in part, be shared with the registry operator. As required by ICANN, this information must also be made publicly available by means of Whois, and that the registry operator may also be required to make this information publicly available by Whois. Both Manic Host and the registry operator may be required to archive this information with a third party escrow service. You hereby consent and give permission for all such requirements and disclosures. Further, you represent and warrant that, if you are providing information about a third party, you have notified the third party of the disclosure and the purpose for the disclosure and you have obtained the third party's consent to such disclosure.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>OBLIGATIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS RELATING TO THE ACCOUNT AND WHOIS CONTACT INFORMATION.</b></p>
        <p>In the event that, in registering a domain name or obtaining other Service(s), you provide information about or on behalf of a third party, you represent that you have (a) provided notice to that third party of the disclosure and use of that party's information as set forth in this Agreement, and (b) that you have obtained the third party's express consent to the disclosure and use of that party's information as set forth in this Agreement. Further, when registering a domain name on behalf of a third party, you agree to inform any customer of yours, who may be acquiring a domain name through you using Manic Host's registration services, that they are in fact registering their domain name through Manic Host and that Manic Host or its provider is an accredited registrar with ICANN. You agree not to represent that you are an ICANN accredited registrar or that you are in any way providing superior access to the ICANN Domain Name Registry. You also agree not to use the ICANN trademark logo in any of your promotional materials including your web site. By registering a domain name or applying for other Service(s) you also represent that the statements in your application are true and you also represent that the domain name is not being registered or the Services being procured for any unlawful purpose. You acknowledge that providing inaccurate information or failing to update information promptly will constitute a material breach of this Agreement and will be sufficient basis for suspension or termination of Services to you. As indicated elsewhere in this Agreement, you understand that it is important for you to regularly monitor email sent to the email address associated with your account and WHOIS contact information because, among other reasons, if a dispute arises regarding a domain name(s) or other Service(s), you may lose your rights to the domain name(s) or your right to receive the Service(s) if you do not respond appropriately to an email sent in conjunction therewith.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>ACCOUNT SECURITY.</b></p>
        <p>Please safeguard your account login identifier and password from any unauthorized use. You agree that any person in possession of your account login identifier and password will have the ability and your authorization to modify your account and domain name information. We will take reasonable precautions to protect the information we obtain from you from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction of that information and that such reasonable precautions include procedures for releasing account access information to parties who claim to have lost account access information. You agree that, if we take reasonable precautions in relation thereto, that IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE IF SUCH REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS DO NOT PREVENT THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OR MISUSE OF YOUR ACCOUNT IDENTIFIER OR PASSWORD AND THAT, EVEN IF WE FAIL TO TAKE REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS, THAT OUR LIABILITY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL BE LIMITED BY THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISION FOUND BELOW IN THIS AGREEMENT. If you contact us alleging that a third party has unauthorized access to your account or domain names, you agree that we may charge you administrative fees of $50 (US dollars) per hour for our time spent in relation to the matter, regardless of whether or not we return control over the account and/or domain names to you.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>TRANSFERS OF DOMAIN NAMES.</b></p>
        <p>You agree that transfer of your domain name(s) services shall be governed by ICANN's transfer policy, available at http://www.icann.org/transfers/, as this policy may be modified from time to time. You agree that we may place a "Registrar Lock" on your domain name services and that this will prevent your domain name services from being transferred without your authorization, though we are not required to do so. By allowing your domain name services to remain locked, you provide express objection to any and all transfer requests until the lock is removed. To transfer your domain name(s) you should first login to your account to lock or unlock your domain name(s) and/or to obtain the EPP "AuthCode" which is required to transfer domain services in an EPP registry (such as .org). Only the registrant and the administrative contacts listed in the WHOIS information may approve or deny a transfer request. Without limitation, domain name services may not be transferred within 60 calendar days of initial registration, within 60 calendar days of a transfer, if there is a dispute regarding the identity of the domain name registrant, if you are bankrupt, or if you fail to pay fees when due. Transfer requests typically take five business days to be processed. A transfer will not be processed if, during this time, the domain name registration services expire in which event you may need to reinstate the transfer request. You may be required to resubmit a transfer request if there is a communication failure. AS A CONSEQUENCE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR FAILURE OF A TRANSFER IF THE TRANSFER PROCESS IS INITIATED CLOSE TO THE END OF A REGISTRATION TERM.</p>

    <li><p><b>PRIVACY POLICY.</b></p>
        <p>You agree and consent that we will make available the domain name registration information you provide or that we otherwise maintain to the following parties: ICANN, the registry administrator(s), and to other third parties as ICANN and applicable laws may require or permit (including through web-based and other on-line WHOIS lookup systems), whether during or after the term of your domain name registration services of the domain name. You hereby irrevocably waive any and all claims and causes of action you may have arising from such disclosure or use of such information. Additionally, you acknowledge that ICANN may establish or modify the guidelines, limits and/or requirements that relate to the amount and type of information that we may or must make available to the public or to private entities, and the manner in which such information is made available. Information regarding ICANN's guidelines and requirements regarding WHOIS can be found at http://www.icann.org/registrars/wmrp.htm, http://www.icann.org/registrars/wdrp.htm, and elsewhere on the ICANN website at http://www.icann.org/index.html.

We reserve the right to discontinue providing bulk WHOIS data access to third parties. You agree that, to the extent permitted by ICANN policies and regulations, Manic Host may make use of the publicly available information you provided during the registration process. If you engage in the reselling of domain names you agree to provide any individuals whose personal information you've obtained, information about the possible uses of their personal information pursuant to ICANN policy.

    Manic Host's designated agent to receive notification of claimed infringement can be reached at admin@manic.host</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>USE OF FREE SERVICES.</b></p>
        <p>In consideration for providing additional optional Services for which we do not charge an additional fee, including, but not limited to, URL forwarding, email forwarding, free parking page, free website hosting, free email services, or other services which we may introduce from time to time but for which there is not a separate fee ("Free Services"), you agree that, if you use such Free Services, we may display advertising in conjunction therewith through the use of pop-up or pop-under browser windows, banner advertisements, audio or video streams, appendices to emails, or other similar advertising means, and that we may aggregate related usage data by means of cookies and other similar means. You agree that from time to time we may provide you with free or low-cost domain name(s) services ("Promotional Name(s)"). If we do so, the services for the Promotional Name(s) will be placed in the same account as your other domain name(s) and you will be listed as the registrant, though we may point the Promotional Name to IP address(es)of our choosing. If you want to assume control over the services provided to the Promotional Name, including the right to transfer or push the Promotional Name service to other registrars or other accounts or the ability to control the DNS settings for the Promotional Name, you must pay the promotional registration fee or renewal fee, if any, and agree to the terms of this Agreement with respect to such Promotional Name(s). If you do not want the Promotional Name services, you may request that you be removed as the registrant of such Promotional Names and we will be listed as the domain name registrant. Alternatively, you may contact us or your Primary Service Provider to request that we delete the Promotional Name from the namespace. For any domain name services, including these Promotional Names, for which you are listed as registrant but for which you do not pay the registration or renewal fee, you agree that we may assign name-servers to the domain name and point the domain name to IP address(es) designated by us until the registration or renewal fee is paid.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>AFTER EXPIRATION OF THE TERM OF A DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION.</b></p>
        <p>Immediately after the expiration of the term of domain name registration services and before deletion of the domain name in the applicable registry's database, you acknowledge that we may direct the domain name to name-servers and IP address(es) designated by us, including, without limitation, to no IP address or to IP address(es) which host a parking page or a commercial search engine that may display advertisements, and you acknowledge that we may either leave your WHOIS information intact or that we may change the contact information in the WHOIS output for the expired domain name so that you are no longer the listed registrant of the expired domain name.</p>

    Reactivation Period Process. For a period of approximately 27 days after expiration of the term of domain name registration services, you acknowledge that we may provide a procedure by which expired domain name registration services may be renewed. You acknowledge and agree that we may, but are not obligated to, offer this process, called the "reactivation period." You acknowledge that you assume all risks and all consequences if you wait until close to or after the expiration of the original term of domain name registration services to attempt to renew the domain name registration services. You acknowledge that we, for any reason and in our sole discretion, may choose not to offer a reactivation period and that we shall not be liable therefore. You acknowledge that reactivation period renewal processes, if any, may involve additional fees which we and your Primary Service Provider may determine. You acknowledge and agree that we may make expired domain name services(s) available to third parties, that we may auction off the rights to expired domain name services (the auction beginning close to the end or after the end of the reactivation period), and/or that expired domain name registration services may be re-registered to any party at any time.

    After the reactivation period, you agree that we may either (i) discontinue the domain name registration services at any time thereafter, (ii) that we may pay the registry's registration fee or otherwise provide for the registration services to be continued, or, (iii) if we auctioned the domain name services to a third party, that we may transfer the domain name registration services to such third party.

    In the case of (i), above, you acknowledge that certain registry administrators may provide procedures by which discontinued domain name registration services may nonetheless be renewed. You acknowledge and agree that we may, but are not obligated to, participate in this process, typically called the "Redemption Grace Period" ("RGP"). You acknowledge that we, for any reason and in our sole discretion, may choose not to participate in the RGP process with respect to any or all of your domain name registration services and that we shall not be liable therefore. If available, RGP typically ends between 30 and 42 days after the end of the reactivation period of the domain name services, as the reactivation period applied to you. The typical RGP fee is $200 plus any registration fees. You agree that we are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are being discontinued.

    In the case of (ii), above, you acknowledge that we may then set the name-servers and the DNS settings for the domain name services, that we set the DNS to point to no IP address or to IP address(es) which host parking page(s) or a commercial search engine that may display paid advertisements, and you acknowledge that we may change the contact information in the WHOIS output for the expired domain name so that you are no longer the listed registrant of the expired domain name. You acknowledge that we do not have to pay you any of the proceeds, if any, we may earn as a result. You agree that we are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are being continued. In this case, the domain name will be designated as being in the extended redemption grace period ("ERGP"), and you will be allowed to assume, during the first 120 days of the then extant registration term, complete management of the domain name services, including the right to control the DNS settings, provided that you pay a fee of $200 (US dollars) plus any registration fees. After the end of the 120-day period, if you do not exercise your rights under this provision, you agree that you have abandoned the domain name services, and relinquish all rights and use of the domain name services.

    In the case of (iii), above, the third party who won the auction for the domain name services will control the domain name services, including control over the WHOIS information and the DNS settings. You may recover the domain name registration services for a period of up to 40 days after the end of the reactivation period, as such reactivation period applied to you. You agree that we are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are or were auctioned. You acknowledge that we do not have to pay you any of the proceeds, if any, we may earn as a result of such an auction. To exercise your rights to recover auctioned domain name services, you must contact us and provide us with a certified letter addressed to "Expiration Recovery" and including documents setting forth your identity and address, which identity and address must be the same as that of the registrant as it was listed in the WHOIS information for the domain name services prior to expiration, a copy of a commonly accepted (in the United States) picture ID (such as a drivers license or passport) which supports your identity and address claim, a front and back photocopy of your credit card and you must a statement authorizing payment of the reinstatement fee to such credit card, which is $200 plus any registration fees. In doing so, you must provide us with sufficient time to allow us to receive and evaluate your documents and to contact the auction winner prior to the end of 30 days after the end of the reactivation period of the domain name services.</p>

    <h2 id="whoisguardagreement">Manic Host WHOIS Proxy Agreement</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
            <p>This Manic Host WHOIS Proxy Agreement (“Proxy Agreement”) sets forth the terms and conditions of your use of the services offered by Whoisguard, Inc., a Republic of Panama corporation, (“Whoisguard”) and Manic Host, Inc., a Delaware corporation, (“Manic Host”) pursuant to the Services Agreement by and between Whoisguard and Manic Host, wherein Whoisguard agrees to provide consumers of Manic Host’s domain name registration and hosting services (“Manic Host Registrant”) with WHOIS privacy protection services (“Whoisguard Services Agreement”).

            <p>This Proxy Agreement serves to supplement your Domain Registration Agreement and/or Hosting Services Agreement between you on the one hand and Manic Host on the other hand, and which is incorporated herein by reference. In this Proxy Agreement “you” and “your” refer to you or any agent, employee, servant or person authorized to act on your behalf, and the Manic Host Registrant listed in the WHOIS contact information for the domain name. This Proxy Agreement explains Manic Host’s obligations to you in connection with your WHOIS privacy protection services, and explains your obligations to Manic Host for privacy protection services offered by third party Whoisguard under the Whoisguard Services Agreement.
        </li>
        <li><p><b>WHOISGUARD PROXY SERVICES</b></p>
            <p>By subscribing to the Manic Host WHOIS Privacy Protection Services (“WHOIS Privacy Services”), you are engaging Whoisguard to administer and register each domain name controlled by you (“Protected Domain”) in the name of WhoisGuard. Thus, your name, postal address, email address, phone and fax numbers shall be kept confidential, subject to this Proxy Agreement. The following information (and not your personal information) will be made publicly available in the WHOIS directory for each Protected Domain:
            <p><ul>
                <li>An account specific WhoisGuard email address, and WhoisGuard postal address and phone and facsimile number for the registrant, administrative, technical, and billing contacts (“WhoisGuard Addresses”);</li>
                <li>The primary and secondary domain name servers you designate for the Protected Domain;</li>
                <li>The Protected Domain’s original date of registration and expiration date; and</li>
                <li>The identity of your registrar, domain name service provider (if different from registrar) and the status of the Protected Domain with the registrar (such as, “active,” “Registrar Lock,” “clienthold,” etc.).</li>
            </ul></p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>YOUR RIGHTS</b></p>
            <p>You will retain the right to sell, transfer, or assign each Protected Domain.
            <p>You will retain the right to control and set the DNS settings for the Protected Domain(s).
            <p>You will retain the right to renew each Protected Domain name registration upon expiration (subject to your Manic Host’s applicable rules and policies).
            <p>You will remain responsible to resolve any and all monetary or other legal claims that arise in connection with your Protected Domain(s), subject to the remaining provisions of this Proxy Agreement, the Whoisguard Services Agreement, and your Domain Registration Agreement and/or Hosting Services Agreement with Manic Host (collectively, “Agreements”).
        </li>
        <li><p><b>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>
            <p>You agree that for each Protected Domain, you will provide to Whoisguard and maintain as current and accurate, the following information:</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Your name, address, email address, postal address, phone and fax numbers;</li>
                <li>The name, address, email address, postal address, phone and fax numbers for the Protected Domain’s administrative, technical, and billing contacts; and</li>
                <li>The primary and secondary domain name servers for the Protected Domain.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>You agree to:</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Update this information immediately as it changes over time;</li>
                <li>Respond within five (5) business days to any inquiries made by Whoisguard to determine the validity of personal information provided by you;</li>
                <li>Promptly respond to messages regarding correspondence addressed to or involving your Protected Domain(s), as more fully set forth below.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>If you do not supply primary and secondary domain name servers, you agree that Whoisguard or Manic Host may point your Protected Domain(s) to an IP address of its choosing until such time as you supply primary and secondary domain name servers.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>RENEWAL AND FEES</b></p>
            <p>If you have selected automatic renewal of the WHOIS Privacy Services administered by Whoisguard, you agree:
            <p><ul>
                <li>That the WHOIS Privacy Services shall be automatically renewed 30 days prior to the end of term of your Domain Name Registration Agreement or Hosting Services Agreement with Manic Host;</li>
                <li>That Whoisguard will attempt to charge your Manic Host account at the then current rates;</li>
                <li>That you waive any requirement to obtain your ongoing affirmative consent to any such automatic renewal.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>If you do not wish to automatically renew the WHOIS Privacy Services administered by Whoisguard, you agree that the exclusive method for communicating this shall be by logging into your Manic Host Account to ensure that the auto-renewal or renewal option is not selected. You understand that you must do this at least 31 days prior to the end of the then current Term (as defined below).</p>
            <p>It is your responsibility to keep necessary funds in your Manic Host Account. If Whoisguard is unable to collect renewal or other fees, you agree that Whoisguard may contact you, but is not obliged to do so, and you agree that Whoisguard may suspend or terminate the WHOIS Privacy Services as a result of inability to obtain payment.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>TERM OF SERVICES</b></p>
            <p>You understand that the term of WHOIS Privacy Services administered by Whoisguard begins on the date your attempt to purchase the WHOIS Privacy Services is accepted by Whoisguard and that it shall run for the unit of time which you order (“Term”). You understand that the Term may be different than the registration term of the Protected Domain which is associated with Manic Host. If a Protected Domain registration expires and is deleted before the end of the Term of the associated WHOIS Privacy Services, then the WHOIS Privacy Services associated with the domain will end when the Protected Domain is deleted and you understand that there will be no refund for any resulting unused portion of the Term. If the Term ends while the registration term for the Protected Domain is still ongoing, then the WHOIS Privacy Services will no longer be provided, the personal information specified in this Proxy Agreement shall be listed in the public WHOIS Directory output for the (then former) Protected Domain, and the communications forwarding services specified in this Proxy Agreement will no longer be provided.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>YOUR REPRESENTATIONS &amp; WARRANTIES</b></p>
            <p>You represent and warrant that all information provided by you pursuant to this Proxy Agreement is truthful, complete, current and accurate and you represent and warrant that you will maintain all information in this status throughout the term of the Agreements.</p>
            <p>You also represent and warrant that you are using the WHOIS Privacy Services in good faith and that you have no knowledge or reason to believe that your Protected Domain or the content found at any associated IP address infringes upon or conflicts with the legal rights of any third party or any third party’s trademark or trade name.</p>
            <p>You also warrant that neither the WHOIS Privacy Services nor Protected Domain(s) will be used in connection with any illegal or morally objectionable activity (as defined below), or, in connection with the transmission of unsolicited commercial email(s) (“Spam”). Further, you represent and warrant that you will not provide any third party with the WhoisGuard Addresses for the purpose of having such third party transmit communications to you through Whoisguard.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>
            <p>Notwithstanding your purchase of the WHOIS Privacy Services administered by Whoisguard, Manic Host reserves the right in its sole judgment and discretion to disclose your personal protected information, or instruct Whoisguard to disclose such information, in the event any of the following occur:</p>
            <p><ul>
            <li>If the Protected Domain(s) is (are) alleged to violate or infringe a third party’s trademark, trade name, copyright interests or other legal rights of third parties;</li>

            <li>If you breach any provision of the Agreements incorporated herein by reference;</li>
            <li>If you breach any provision of your Domain Name Registration Agreement or Hosting Services Agreement with Manic Host;</li>
            <li>If necessary to comply with any applicable laws, government rules or requirements, subpoenas, court orders or requests of law enforcement;</li>
            <li>If Manic Host is named as a defendant in, or investigated in anticipation of, any legal or administrative proceeding arising out of your use of the WHOIS Privacy Services or a Protected Domain;</li>
            <li>If necessary to comply with ICANN’s Dispute Resolution Policy or other policies promulgated by ICANN;</li>
            <li>If necessary to avoid any financial loss or legal liability (civil or criminal) on the part of Manic Host or its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, agents, officers, directors and employees;</li>
            <li>If necessary to protect the integrity and stability of the applicable domain name registry; or</li>
            <li>If it comes to Backend Service Provider’s attention that you are alleged to be using the WHOIS Privacy Services administered by WhoisGuard for purposes of engaging in, participating in, sponsoring or hiding your involvement in illegal or morally objectionable activities, including but not limited to, activities which are designed, intended to or otherwise:

            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>In the event Manic Host decides to take any of the actions set forth above or in the event you elect to cancel the WHOIS Privacy Services administered by Whoisguard for any reason, Manic Host shall not be liable for fees paid by you for the WHOIS Privacy Services administered by Whoisguard.</li>
            </ul></p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>COMMUNICATIONS</b></p>
            <p>You agree that from time to time, Whoisguard (and if applicable, Manic Host) will review communications sent to the WhoisGuard Addresses associated with your Protected Domain.</p>
            <p>For communications received via certified or traceable courier mail (such as UPS, FedEx, or DHL), or first class mail which does not appear to be unsolicited commercial mail, you agree that Whoisguard may either i) forward such communication to you or ii) may attempt to communicate to you a scanned copy of a page of the communication to ascertain how you wish Whoisguard to proceed with respect to that communication.</p>
            <p>You understand that Whoisguard may, in its own judgment and discretion, elect to not forward to you such first class postal mail or email, fax, postal mail or telephone communications which appear to be unsolicited communications, which offer or advertise the sale of goods or services or which solicit charitable contributions, or communications which appear to arise from your use of the WHOIS Privacy Services administered by Whoisguard as a general mail forwarding service. You authorize Whoisguard to either discard all such communications or return all such communications to sender unopened.</p>
            <p>You agree to waive any and all claims arising from your failure to receive communications directed to your domain name but not forwarded to you by Whoisguard, including such failures which arise from Whoisguard’s mistake of judgment made in good faith in determining whether a communication is or is not an unsolicited communication.</p>
            <p>The public WHOIS Directory generally requires an email address for every purchased domain name registration. When you purchase WHOIS Privacy Services administered by Whoisguard, an email address will be automatically generated for the corresponding Protected Domain (e.g. XXXXXX.protect@whoisguard.com). Thereafter, when messages are sent to the email address listed in the WhoisGuard Address, Whoisguard will forward such messages to the email address you provided to WhoisGuard, in accordance with this Proxy Agreement. If such email address becomes non-functioning or if the email to such address bounces, WhoisGuard shall not be obligated to attempt to contact you through other means. You agree that WhoisGuard may elect in its sole discretion, to allow you to access the email server logs if available and view email information sent to the Whoisguard Addresses, though such alternative means of servicing your Account is an option and not a requirement.</p>
            <p>When Whoisguard receives a communication to the Protected Domain, Whoisguard will send an email to the email address you provided to Whoisguard in accordance with this Proxy Agreement. The email message from Whoisguard to you will identify the sender of the correspondence and the date received. As an alternative, you agree that Whoisguard may allow you to access your account to view full or partial scanned copies of (non-email) communications sent to the Protected Addresses and that you may be required to interact with your account to have the physical originals of such communications forwarded to you and that if you do not interact with your account in the ways indicated upon accessing your account, that the communications may not be forwarded to you. In either event, you will have seventy-two (72) hours to decide whether to have the communication(s) forwarded. If you do not respond within this time period, the communication(s) will not be forwarded. Method of forward will be determined by Whoisguard. Communication(s) may not be immediately forwarded upon your election; there may be a delay and communication(s) may be aggregated to be forwarded together.</p>
            <p>You agree to submit to fees where Whoisguard may begin charging fees for forwarding communications or may change the method by which communications are forwarded without written notice.
            <p>In the event you do not respond to communications from Whoisguard, irrespective of whether Whoisguard is forwarding an email or making an unrelated inquiry or communication, Whoisguard may immediately reveal the information you provided in accordance with this Proxy Agreement and/or cancel the WHOIS Privacy Services regarding either the Protected Domain in question or with respect to all of your Protected Domains, depending on the circumstances. This means the Whois directory will revert to displaying your name, postal address, email address and phone number.</p>

        <li><p><b>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b></p>
            <p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL MANIC HOST BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER RELATED TO THIS PROXY AGREEMENT, YOUR DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION, THE WHOIS PRIVACY SERVICES ADMINISTERED BY WHOISGUARD, YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE MANIC HOST WEBSITE(S) OR THE MATERIALS AND CONTENT OF THE WEB SITE(S) OR ANY OTHER WEB SITES LINKED TO SUCH WEB SITE(S) OR YOUR PROVISION OF ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO BACKEND SERVICE PROVIDER OR ANY THIRD PARTY. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF MANIC HOST HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR SUCH DAMAGES WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE. BECAUSE CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE LIMITATION OR ELIMINATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, MANIC HOST’S LIABILITY IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. IF ANY PROVISION OF THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, ONLY SUCH PROVISION SHALL BE REMOVED AND THE REMAINDER SHALL BE ENFORCED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
            <p>You further understand and agree that Manic Host disclaims any loss or liability resulting from:
            <ul>
                <li>The inadvertent disclosure or theft of your personal information;</li>
                <li>Access delays or interruptions to the whoisguard website or the websites of affiliated parties;</li>
                <li>Data non-delivery or inaccurate delivery between you and the providers of the services;</li>
                <li>The failure for whatever reason to renew the WHOIS Privacy Services;</li>
                <li>The unauthorized use of your account or any of the providers of services;</li>
                <li>Errors, omissions or misstatements by providers of services;</li>
                <li>Deletion of, failure to store, failure to process or act upon email messages sent to or forwarded to either you or the email address listed for your protected domain;</li>
                <li>Processing of updated information regarding your account;</li>
                <li>Any act or omission caused by you or your agents (whether authorized by you or not).</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>YOU AGREE THAT, IN ANY EVENT, THE PRIMARY AND BACKEND SERVICE PROVIDERS’ RESPECTIVE MAXIMUM LIABILITY TO YOU SHALL BE CAPPED BY THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNT OF FEES PAID BY YOU TO EACH SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE PRECEDING YEAR WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE LIABILITY OR $100.00 PER PROTECTED DOMAIN.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>INDEMNITY AND DEFENSE</b></p>
            <p>With respect to ICANN, the registry operators, and Manic Host, as well as the contractors, agents, employees, officers, directors, shareholders, and affiliates of such parties, you agree to defend, release, indemnify, and hold such parties harmless from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including attorney’s fees and court costs, for third party claims relating to or arising under the Proxy Agreement, the WHOIS Privacy Services provided hereunder, or your use of the WHOIS Privacy Services, including, without limitation, infringement by you, or by anyone else using the WHOIS Privacy Services provided to you, of any intellectual property or other proprietary right of any person or entity, or from the violation of any of Manic Host’s operating rules or policies relating to the WHOIS Privacy Services provided.</p>
            <p>When Manic Host may be involved in a suit involving a third party and which is related to the WHOIS Privacy Services administered by Whoisguard to you under this Proxy Agreement, Manic Host may seek written assurances from you in which you promise to defend, indemnify and hold Manic Host harmless from the costs and liabilities described in this paragraph. Such written assurances may include, in Manic Host’s sole discretion, the posting of a performance bond(s) or other guarantees reasonably calculated to guarantee payment. Your failure to provide such assurances may be considered by Manic Host to be a breach of this Proxy Agreement by you and may, in Manic Host’s sole discretion, result in loss of your right to control the disposition of domain name services for which you are the registrant and in relation to which Manic Host is the registrar of record.</p>
            <p>Should Manic Host be forced to defend itself in any action or legal proceeding in connection with any WHOIS Privacy Services provided to you, you shall have sole responsibility to defend Manic Host against any such claim by legal counsel of its choosing. This indemnification is in addition to any indemnification required under the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (“UDRP”).</p>
            <p>You agree to release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Primary and Backend Service Providers, and their parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, agents, directors, officers and employees and Your registrar, from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages or costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees, arising out of or related in any way to the Agreements, the web sites of the Service Providers, your Account, and/or your use of your Protected Domain.</p>

    <h1>Copyright and Trademark Complaints</h1>
    <h2 id="copyrighttrademark">Copyright and Trademark Policies</h2>
        <p>At Manic Host, we believe that the customer comes first.  As a result, we’ve developed policies over the years that deal with complaints made to us regarding domains and hosted content.</p>

        <p>In the interest of transparency, we’re proud to provide a summary of how we deal with trademark and copyright complaints, and what we do to make sure our customers come first.</p>

        <p>If we receive a DMCA notice from a copyright holder, here’s what we’ll do:
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure the notice is DMCA-compliant;</li>
            <li>Forward that notice to you, the user, and make it clear how to proceed;</li>
            <li>Restrict access temporarily to the disputed content only, and not your entire site;</li>
            <li>Give you the opportunity to counter-notice the DMCA notice and provide a clear procedure to do so (link to procedure);</li>
            <li>Restore any disputed works promptly upon counter-notice;</li>
            <li>Ensure that if you’ve counter-noticed a DMCA in reference to specific works, that those works are not counted as previous infringements (repeat infringement)</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>If we receive a trademark complaint from a trademark holder, here's what we'll do:
        <ol>
            <li>Require valid and formal notice of a trademark complaint;</li>
            <li>Forward the complaint to you, the user, and make it clear how to proceed;</li>
            <li>Ensure our legal department reviews the complaint first vs. using an automated system;</li>
            <li>Refrain from taking any action in reference to trademark complaints alone (i.e. with no court order), and encourage the parties to resolve the dispute amongst themselves;</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
    <h2 id="dmca">DMCA Counter-Notice Procedure</h2>
        <p>We are in receipt of a copyright infringement notice pursuant to 17 U.S.C. &sect;512 of the Copyright Act, requesting the disabling of infringing material appearing at a domain registered in your account (the "Domain").  Under Manic Host's policy, the content appearing at the Domain has been identified by a reporting copyright owner as infringing and has been removed or disabled.  A copy of the DMCA notice is included in this communication.</p>

        <p>If you believe that the identification of infringing content is in error, we suggest that you contact the reporting copyright owner to resolve the matter. If the reporting copyright owner agrees there is a mistake, have them email Manic Host at legal@manic.host.  In that case the content subject of the Take-Down Notice may be reinstated by you.</p>

        <p>If you are not able to come to an agreement with the reporting copyright owner, you may submit a DMCA Counter-Notice to Manic Host within ten (10) business days of the date of this letter.  Such a Counter-Notice must comply with the requirements of the DMCA. The Counter-Notice is a legal document and requires the following:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Your contact information, including name, address, and telephone number, as well as facsimile number and email if available;</li>
            <li>A statement that under penalty of perjury that you have the good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;</li>
            <li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access was disabled;</li>
            <li>A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court in which the address you provide is located, or if your address is outside the United States, for the judicial district of California;</li>
            <li>A statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the initial notice or an agent of that person; and</li>
            <li>An electronic signature by you or your agent.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>The DMCA Counter-Notice should be sent to manic.host - Email: legal@manic.host.</p>

        <p>Once a valid DMCA Counter-Notice has been submitted, Manic Host will provide a copy of the Counter-Notice to the reporting copyright owner, and will reinstate the material within ten (10) days of receipt.  It shall further advise the complaining party that the listing has been reinstated and shall remain so unless we hear from the reporting copyright owner that he or she has filed an action against you under the DMCA in a court of competent jurisdiction for copyright infringement and is seeking a court order to restrain you from publishing the disputed content.</p>

        <p>By submitting your Counter-Notice to Manic Host, you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Manic Host with respect to any Counter-Notice you send, or claims regarding any aspect of the disputed content and its publication and/or Manic Host's action in implementing a takedown or re-establishing the content, and you agree to indemnify and hold Manic Host, and its owners/operators, affiliates, and/or licensors, harmless to the fullest extent allowed by law regarding all matters relating to your sending of a Counter-Notice.</p>

    <br />
    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>If you have any queries about our policies, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@manic.host">support@manic.host</a> and we'll be glad to talk to you.</b></p>
